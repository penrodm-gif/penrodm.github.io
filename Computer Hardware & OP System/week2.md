There are many types of ram. DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, and VRAM. DRAM is the most common in pcs and they store data in tiny capacitors that must re refreshed thousands of times per second. SRAM is the more expsive and faster than DRAM(doesn't need constant refreshing.) SDRAM is a type of Dram that syncs with the CPU clock for faster performance. DDR SDRAM transfer data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal(has different types DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5.) Lastly there is VRAM and it is specialized memory for graphics cards.
There are 6 types of storage devices (HDD, SSD, NVMe SSD, Hybrid Drive, Optical Drive, and Flash Drives.) HDD uses a spinning magnet to store data and is a cheaper but slower way of holding data. SSd is the more expesive data holder but us much faster than HDD and is more durable. NVMe SSD is the most ideal when it comes to gaming and other high end tasks it is faster than SATA SSDs. Hybrid Drive combines a small SSD cache with a traditional HHD while also offering a balance of speed and capacity at a moderate cost. Optical Storage stores data on discs using lasers and is mostly used for media or backups(least common in modern PCs.) Flash drives are a porable solid-state storage device that is used for quick data transfers and removable storage.
