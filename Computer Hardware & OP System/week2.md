There are many types of ram. DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, and VRAM. DRAM is the most common in pcs and they store data in tiny capacitors that must re refreshed thousands of times per second. SRAM is the more expsive and faster than DRAM(doesn't need constant refreshing.) SDRAM is a type of Dram that syncs with the CPU clock for faster performance. DDR SDRAM transfer data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal(has different types DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, DDR5.) Lastly there is VRAM and it is specialized memory for graphics cards.
